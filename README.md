# Unit2.FreelancerForum

Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor enters the website and finds a list of available freelancers. Each freelancer has a name, an occupation, and a starting price for their services. They observe on the list Alice, the writer with a starting price of $30, and Bob, who is a teacher, has a starting price of $50.

The visitor also finds a message that displays the average starting price of all the freelancers. In this example, the average starting price is $40.

A few seconds later, a new listing appears for a freelancer named Carol, who is a programmer and has a starting price of $70. The average starting price is updated to $50.

New freelancers continue to appear every few seconds, and the average starting price is updated accordingly.
